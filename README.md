Redmine Mentions Suggestions
=============================

Suggest assignee based on note text.

# How does this work?

The first user you mention in a issue comment will be suggested to set as assignee for the current ticket. You can uncheck the box to not change the assignee, otherwise, it will be assigned to this user.
